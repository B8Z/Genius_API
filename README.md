# Genius_API
# How to run
First, download anaconda or find a service online that supports jupyter notebooks.
You can try a browsered version here:
https://jupyter.org/

Next, make sure to properly include the imports that were included in the code.
You will need to pip install lyricsgenius, but that is also included in the code.

Finally, execute and run the program.  This code would also work with python (not in a jupyter notebook); however, you would need to pip install all of the libraries that are included.
